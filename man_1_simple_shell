.SH DESCRIPTION

This simple_shell project is a command line interpreter.
This shell is made for an educational proposition, but includes
the basic functionality of a traditional Unix-like command-line
user interface.
The standard functions and system calls used in simple_shell include:
.B execve,
.B exit,
.B fork,
.B free,
.B _getline,
.B malloc,
.B perror,
.B _strtok,
.B wait,
.B write,
.B getcwd.

particularly this project was designed to be executed in the Linux environment.

Compile simple_shell with the flags:
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE

.SH OPTIONS

simple_shell can be run in interactive mode by typing the following command.
.P
.RS
.B $ ./hsh
.P
.RE
Examples
.P
.RS
.B $ ./hsh
.P
.B linux~$ pwd
.P
.B /home/vagrant/c16/simple_shell
.B

.RE

simple_shell can be run in non-interactive mode by using shell scripts, using pipes ('|'):
.P
.RS
.B echo 'ls' | ./hsh

.SH BUILTINS COMMANDS

Read and execute commands from filename in the current shell environment
and return the exit status of the last command executed from filename.
If filename does not contain a slash,
file names in PATH are used to find the directory containing filename.
The following builtin commands are:

.IT
.B HOME 
- The home directory of the current user and the default directory argument for the cd builtin command.

.B exit
- exits the program.

.B cd
- change directory.

.B env
- Print environment.
The env command will be print a complete list of enviroment variables.


.SH COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIROMENT
The shell has an execution environment, which consists of the following:

- open files inherited by the shell at invocation,
as modified by redirections supplied to the exec builtin.

- the current working directory as set by cd, pushd, or popd,
or inherited by the shell at invocation.

.SH SIGNALS
When bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps,
it ignores SIGTERM (so that kill 0 does not kill an interactive shell),
and SIGINT is caught and handled (so that the wait builtin is interruptible).
In all cases, bash ignores SIGQUIT.
If job control is in effect, bash ignores SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.

.SH PROMPTING
When executing interactively, bash displays the primary prompt PS1
when it is ready to read a command,
and the secondary prompt PS2 when it needs more input to complete a command.
